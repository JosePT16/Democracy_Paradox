    <h1>Democracy Paradox</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">If it causes growth, why is it moving backward?</h2>
</header>

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="text-box">
      <p>At first glance, the relationship between democracy and 
        economic development does not appear entirely clear.
        While most Western developed countries, such as the
        United States, Germany, and Sweden, combine high levels
        of democracy with strong economic performance, there are
        also wealthy non-democratic states like Saudi Arabia, Qatar,
        and Singapore that challenge this pattern. As shown in
        Figure 1, although there is some correlation between a
        country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and its level of
        democracy*, this relationship is not conclusive.
      </p>

  </div>
  <div class="text-box">
    <p>
      This pattern can be explained by several factors. Economic
      growth depends on multiple variables (human capital,
      technological progress, and natural resource endowments)
      making it difficult to isolate the specific influence of political
      institutions. Moreover, some countries may experience
      growth even under extractive systems where power and
      resources are concentrated in the hands of a few.
      However, the relationship between democracy and
      economic growth becomes evident when focusing on
      countries that have passed democratic transitions. Figure 2
      shows the average economic growth before and after a
      transition to democracy (over a 20-year span). As the figure
      suggests, democratization acts as a game-changing factor
      for countries following this path, boosting their economies in
      a consistent and sustained way.
    </p>
  </div>

</div>

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="text-box">
  Moreover, a study of Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo and
  Robinson (2019) found that democratizations increase
  GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. This
  may help explain why democracy has increasingly been
  adopted worldwide over the past two centuries.
  Nevertheless, a considerable portion of the world’s
  population still lives under non-democratic regimes, as
  illustrated in Figure 3. Furthermore, democratic
  backsliding has become increasingly visible in recent
  years (See Figure 4).

<p style="font-weight:700 ; font-size:45px;">So why is it going backwards?</p>


<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="text-box">
    <p>
       
      Democratic consolidation processes are not linear.
      Following Acemoglu and Robinson (2012), the growth
      generated by democracy can alter the balance of power
      creating new economic and political elites that challenge
      existing ones. When institutions remain weak, these elites
      (old or newly emerging) have incentives to capture the
      state, restrict political competition, and manipulate
      institutions to preserve their privileges. Under such
      conditions, the growth that democracy fosters can
      paradoxically lead to a process of democratic backsliding.
    </p>

    <p>
        
        Particularly whether democracy consolidates or backslides depends primarily 
        on two forces: inequality and the cost of repression. When inequality is high and repression is cheap, 
        elites prefer autocracy because they fear redistribution and can suppress opposition. When inequality 
        is low and repression is costly, democracy is more likely to consolidate because elites face little
        threat from revolution and cannot easily repress. Countries with both high inequality and high 
        repression costs tend to be unstable, oscillating during the years between autocracy and democracy 
        (See dynamic figure 5).
    </p>
    <p>
      This dynamics are also reinforced by geographical waves that promote regional democratizations or
      autocratizations. Specifically, when elites see democratization in their neighbors, they perceive
      a higher risk of revolution and are more likely to make democratic concessions. The same but opposite
      mechanism applies when autocratizations happen in the neighbor.
    </p>

    <p>
      After crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, democracy
      has faced renewed pressures and attacks. As Figure 6
      illustrates, countries with stronger democratic institutions
      are generally better equipped to resist these challenges
      and experienced smaller declines in democratic quality.
    <p>
      Democratic backsliding is not an anomaly in history.
      Rather, it reflects a common pattern in which authoritarian
      and democratic waves alternate over time, often
      reinforced by regional dynamics. Periods of
      autocratization have been recurrent throughout history,
      yet so too have waves of democratization (as Figure 7 shows), emerging when
      social, economic, and technological conditions align to
      favor greater inclusion and participation.

<div class="text-box">
While democracy continues to face significant
challenges, empirical evidence consistently indicates
that it offers the most ideal framework for sustainable,
and resilient development. Periods of democratic
backsliding should not be interpreted as systemic
failure, but rather as critical junctures that test the
robustness of democratic institutions. Democracies
has their own mechanisms of accountability,
participation, and institutional renewal that reienforce
its capacity for self-correction and reform.
In an increasingly interconnected world, where
democratic experiences circulate beyond national
boundaries, new waves of political openness may
emerge, fostered by more informed and demanding
societies. Historical experience suggests that episodes
of regression are often temporary, whereas the
aspiration for freedom, equality, and representation
persists as a central driver of human progress.
